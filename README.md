# mancala

Refer to Mancala_Report.pdf for a more in-depth breakdown.  

Abstract: Mancala is a classic board game enjoyed by many around the world. Our Prolog program, which was created for our CP468 | Artificial Intelligence final project, uses various Prolog techniques. In addition to this, AI was developed using MiniMax search with a depth of 5, and other algorithms to pose a challenge. Two AIs vary in difficulty, one which is an “easy” AI that incorporates random selection, and one that uses the aforementioned MiniMax search to find the best move. 

This was a project submission for CP468 | Artificial Intelligence, which required us to understand and utilize Prolog to create a playable game. Students were encouraged to find existing projects/sources of inspiration and customize them to their own experience, with a strong emphasis on understanding how to use AI implementation in them.

Special thanks to my group members Aren Melkon & Yousef Hozayen, as well as Karolina Cynk for providing some much needed foundation for this project.
